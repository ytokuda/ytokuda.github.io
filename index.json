In this paper we introduce the concept of PickCells, a fully re-configurable device concept composed of cells, that breaks the mould of rigid screens and explores a modular system that affords rich sets of tangible interactions and novel across-device relationships. Through a series of co-design activities -- involving HCI experts and potential end-users of such systems -- we synthesised a design space aimed at inspiring future research, giving researchers and designers a framework in which to explore modular screen interactions. The design space we propose unifies existing works on modular touch surfaces under a general framework and broadens horizons by opening up unexplored spaces providing new interaction possibilities. This project explored the PickCells concept, a design space of modular touch surfaces, and proposed a toolkit for quick scenario prototyping.\r\r\r\r\u0026ensp;Research Concept\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\u0026ensp;System Demonstration\r\r\r\rTangible Passwords \r\rMinimalism\n\r\rCrowd Contribution\n\r\r\r\r\r\u0026ensp;Main Video \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\u0026ensp;Publications\r\r\r\rPaper Alix Goguey, Cameron Steer, Andr\u0026eacute;s Lucero, Laurence Nigay, Deepak Ranjan Sahoo, C\u0026eacute;line Coutrix, Anne Roudaut, Sriram Subramanian, Yutaka Tokuda, Timothy Neate, Jennifer Pearson, Simon Robinson, Matt Jones. 2019.

Most of these applications share two key limitations: a) the complexity of the sound fields that can be produced is limited by the physical size of the transducers; and b) no obstacles can be present between the transducers and the control point. We proposed SoundBender, a hybrid system that overcomes these limitations by combining the versatility of phased arrays of Transducers(PATs) with the precision of acoustic metamaterials. In this project, we explored a new approach to design and implement such hybrid modulators (i.e. to create complex sound fields) and methods to manipulate the field dynamically (i.e. stretch, steer).

It presents digital information interactively by tracing dynamic patterns on horizontal flat surfaces using liquid metal drops on a programmable electrode array. It provides tactile feedback with directional information in the 2D vector plane using linear locomotion and/or vibration of the liquid metal drops. We demonstrate move, oscillate, merge, split and dispense-from-reservoir functions of the liquid metal drops by consuming low power (450 mW per electrode) and low voltage (8--15 V). We reported on results of our empirical study with 12 participants on tactile feedback using 8 mm diameter drops, which indicated that Tangible Drops can convey tactile sensations such as changing speed, varying direction and controlled oscillation with no visual feedback.

Mistform combines affordances from both shape changing interfaces and mid-air displays. For example, a concave display can maintain content in comfortable reach for a single user, while a convex shape can support several users engaged on individual tasks. MistForm also enables unique interaction possibilities by exploiting the synergies between shape changing interfaces and mid-air fog displays. For instance, moving the screen will affect the brightness and blurriness of the screen at specific locations around the display, creating spaces with similar (collaboration) or different visibility (personalized content). We describe the design of MistForm and analyse its inherent challenges, such as image distortion and uneven brightness on dynamic curved surfaces.

Conventional 3D floating displays, however, suffer from limited viewing angles and visual fatigues due\rto vergence-accommodation conflict. Recently, one of the solutions to these issues was addressed by aerial imaging by\rretro-reflection (AIRR) in which\rreflective sheeting is used to focus images in mid-air space. Conventional AIRR methods have limited its\rapplications due to the low light efficiency, and hence it is difficult to deploy standard LCDs to\rcreate visible enough floating images. To improve the light efficiency of AIRR, we proposed a polarized AIRR\r(pAIRR) method inspired by LCD backlight recycling technique. Utilizing enhanced brightness, we explored a new optical\rdesign to create 2.5D displays that provide visible floating images above a tabletop touch screen, which enables\rusers to smoothly interact with both floating digital objects and contents displayed on the touch screen. This research was initiated from my research internship project at\rApplied Sciences Group in Microsoft\rResearch  in Redmond. Furthere improvements of optical designs were investigated at The University of Tokyo  and Utsunomiya University  in Japan. The project contributed to\rindustry commercializing the research outcome as novel aerial display components  and DIY floating display kits.\r\r\r\r\u0026ensp;Research Overview\r\r\r\r\r1\u0026ensp;Polarized Aerial Imaging by Retroreflection (pAIRR)\n\r\r2\u0026ensp;42-inch Floating Display Prototype System\n\r\r3\u0026ensp;Spatio Temporally Multiplexed 2.5D Floating Display\n\r\r4\u0026ensp;Holographic Screen based 2.5D Floating Display\n\r\r5\u0026ensp;2.5D LED Floating Display by Transparent Retroreflector\n\r\r\r\r\u0026ensp;System Demonstration\r\r\rFirst Prototype Works \r\rLittle Earth \r\rSolar System \r\rElectric Arc \r\r2.5D Sparkling Spellbook \r\r2.5D GUI \r\r2.5D Floating Dragon \rSecond Prototype Works  \r\r42-inch Unity-Chan \r\r42-inch Plasma Ball\n\r\r2.5D Solar System\n\rOther Fun Works  \r\r2.5D Floating LED Display \r\rFloating 3D Object \r\rFloating Image over Water Surface \r\r\r\r\r\u0026ensp;Main Video\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\u0026ensp;Publications\r\r\r\rPaper Yutaka Tokuda, Kenta Onuki, Masashi Takahashi, Sho Onose,\rTomoyuki Okamoto, Michitaka Hirose, Hirotsugu Yamamoto. 2015.

Conventional telepresence methods are, however, limited to a face-to-face communication utilizing a static flat-panel display or a physically constrained humanoid robot, which lack the presence of a remote operator, non-verbal communication cues such as a body language, and the freedom of mobility. In this project, we explored a mobile embodied 3D avatar system to shift a rich expressiveness of full-body avatar from virtual world to daily life by integrating a high maneuvability into a human-scale semi-transparent holographic display. We investigated a novel architecture to contorl embodied multimodal avatar by deploying a multimodal behavior generation framework, SAIBA (Situation, Agent, Intention, Behavior, Animation). Synergy effects of a physical movement through a moveable robotic display and a smooth computer graphic animaiton visualized on a 3D display demonstrated a dynamic visual media expression for Spatial Augmented Reality, which can improve the presence and non-verbal communication cues of a remote operator.\r\r\r\r\u0026ensp;System Overview\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\u0026ensp;System Demonstration\r\r\r\rRemote Lecture from Home \r\rDynamical 3D Depth Animation\n\r\rOutdoor Test \r\r\r\r\r\u0026ensp;Main Video \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\u0026ensp;Publications\r\r\r\rPaper Yutaka Tokuda, Atsushi Hiyama, Takahiro Miura, Tomohiro Tanikawa, Michitaka Hirose. 2013.

While a fog screen has been the standard method of particle floating displays, it requires a high-pressure particle diffuser or an air curtain system to stabilize the flow of particles within a thin layer or a certain small volume around particle diffuser; the depth expression is limited by the volume of a fog screen system. To form a laminar particle screen in the outside free space, alternative particle control techniques must be examined. We proposed Vortex Ring Display as a novel projectile fog screen which can significantly extend the stability of a laminar fog screen in a large depth. Vortex ring has been well known for the unique vortex stability and transportation capability, which encompasses a slug of particles within a circulating volume and thus continuously fly at the constant speed without dispersing the particles in the surrounding air. We extensively studied the usability and limitation of vortex ring displays from viewpoints of stability and quality of floating images. Our empirical study showed that vortex ring display can physically transport a floating screen toward a distant user who stands at four meters of distance away from the display system, supporting a large depth of 3D expression without vergence-accommodation conflict. The relationship between the stability of vortex ring and the quality of projected floating images was studied to find the optimal condition. Taking advantage of vortex ring's mid-air haptics feedback and capability of delivering scented air together, vortex ring display can be used as a multisensory floating interface for 4D movie and high-presence digital signage. Furthermore, vortex ring arrays based display system, Cloud display, was examined as the method to extend the imaging space for multi-users.

One can also think of it as a novel public augmented reality display system. The design aimed to make the entire display system as a short resting place for pedestrians walking by it, which is like a mother tree that shades and relaxes many living things in nature. The artwork consists of a toric couch, a screen-supporting pillar, and a propeller screen made of six light-weight blades. By resting on the couch, we can see the floating image projected on the propeller screen above. The display utilized persistence of vision  to form a complete continuous image from the spinning propeller screen. To compensate for the environmental light in the public place, the propeller's blades were made of a retroreflective  screen material which can directionally reflect the projected images to viewers under the screen. The work was demonstrated as a digital public art installation in Tokyo International Airport (Haneda Airport) , which is the biggest airport in Japan. We visualized the flight schedule at Haneda airport with avatars of animated bird pictures and projected them on the propeller screen. A virtual flight ticket registration system allowed users to interactively create their custom avatars based on their flight information and their profile pictures. To relieve the body of a user, the couch was made of a plastic-fiber based cushion material, TOYOBO BREATHAIR , which imitates an organic 3D structure of bird's nest made of mutually entangled fibers. This work was first experimentally exhibited for three days at The University of Tokyo Komaba Research Campus Open House, and then a four-month public exhibition was held in Haneda airport between October 2009 and January 2010. This research was conducted in collaboration with a media artist Yasuhiro Suzuki under the support of CREST Digital Public Art Project. \r\r\r\u0026ensp;Main Ideas\r\r\r\r1\u0026ensp;Vision of Spatially Augmented Resting Place in Public Space\n\r\r\r2\u0026ensp;System Overview\n\r\r3\u0026ensp;Design and User Experience\n\r\r\r\r\r\u0026ensp;System Demonstration\r\r\rFloating Clock (1st prototype) \r\rUniversity of Tokyo Open House Demo (2nd prototype) \r\r\r\r\r\u0026ensp;Main Video \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\u0026ensp;Publications\r\r\r\rPaper Kunihiro Nishimura, Yasuhiro Suzuki, Yutaka Tokuda, Tomohiro Iida, Takashi Kajinami, Tomohiro Tanikawa, Michitaka Hirose. 2009.
